Linear regression is a type of supervised statistical learning approach that is useful for predicting
a quantitative response Y. It can take the form of a single regression problem (where you use only
a single predictor variable X) or a multiple regression (when more than one predictor is used in
the model). It is one of the simplest and most straightforward approaches available and it is a
starting point for more advanced modelling and predictive exercises.
The project taken up will illustrate the application of a linear regression exercise using one
predictor (Simple Linear Regression) as well as two predictors.
The dataset used is called Prestige and comes from the car package library(car). The Prestige
dataset is a data frame with 102 rows and 6 columns. Each row is an observation that relates to an
occupation. The columns relate to predictors such as average years of education, percentage of
women in the occupation, prestige of the occupation, etc. The occupations illustrated are of from
the nation of Canada and hence the following analysis is in relation with the general Canadian
public working class.
The six columns corresponding to a particular job are education, income,number of Â women,
prestige, census type. We mainly make use of Education, income, number of women and prestige
columns to co-relate and deduce are theories. To clarify on the columns being used, the prestige
column literally indicates the prestige and high regard of the job in the Canadian society based
upon various social surveys. The higher the number is of prestige, more prestigious the job is.
Hence, we come to are one of our fundamental analysis from the data set which compares Income
with Prestige and Education. The Simple Linear Regression applied helps up understand us better
how income and prestige are intertwined in modern society and helps establish us an important
relationship between various critical factors in the ocean of jobs and employability. We find a
similar such relationship of income with education and thus try to emphasize of the importance of
education.
